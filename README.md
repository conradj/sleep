sleep
=====
8-12 weeks
----

[Most babies do not show any predictability during the first 2/3 months][1]

### Sleep times for consistently well rested babys. Not normal, but a guide
2. [Max wake time of 0.75 hours, increasing to 1.5 hours at 3 months][2]
3. [Avg. daily sleep requirement 16-20 hours reducing to 15.5-18 hours at 3 months][2]
4. [4 ish naps, limited to 3 hours max (I wish!)][2]

### Further timing information
1. [Newborns typically have a late bedtime (anywhere between 9-11pm) but it gradually shifts earlier from 7/8 weeks][1]
2. [Newborns take 20 minutes to go into a deep sleep.][4]

### Getting them to sleep
1. Ensure fed and dry
2. Cry it out (COI) is not acceptable at this age [add source]. A small amount of sleep training is OK, as follows ([all from link as before][1]):
  - Try putting her down drowsy.
  - If she's not near settling after 30mins, then allow her to sleep on you before severe overtiredness sets in and try again next time.
  - The same when she wakes at night and you know she's not wet/hungry. If she's just fussing, try the wait-and-see approach. Do not rush in. Let her try and work it out herself first for 2-10mins, depending on the type of cries. If she's getting distressed and need some help, go to her earlier and try soothing her in her crib first by hushing/patting/rubbing or just a heavy hand for 15/20mins. If that does not comfort her at all, then do what works to get her to sleep, and try again next time.
3. Swaddle, hold on left side, shush loudly, swing and use dummy for sucking [(5 s's)][3]
